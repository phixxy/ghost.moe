Guidelines/thoughts for now:

The website should be pure html/css.
No javascript.
Each tip should be in its own box.
If you need multiple tips in one box, maybe that box should be a section.
This guide is meant as a starting point for these topics, this guide will teach users *what they need to learn* (I need to emphasize that users should be searching why they should do these things).
The target audience is someone who is interested in privacy, security, or anti-censorship tools, and is at a minimum, comfortable downloading programs and opening settings.
The webpage should be a single file with <style> tags at the top so that the file can be easily downloaded for offline viewing.
Eventually I would like multiple languages to be supported, each one will be its own html file, there can be a banner at the top to link to each language.

Goals:
Help at least one person with privacy/security/anti-censorship.
