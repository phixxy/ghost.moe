          Welcome to ghost.moe. This guide is meant to help you take control of
          your digital privacy and security. With more privacy and security, comes
          less convenience. This is an unfortunate reality. We've broken things down
          by topic, and each topic has three levels: 
          <ul class="level_guide">
            <li>
              <span class="convenient">More Convenient:</span>
              These items will only require a download or checking a box in settings.
              They shouldn't break anything, be annoying, or slow anything down.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="balanced">Balanced:</span>
              These items can cause some minor things to break, be slightly annoying, or require
              a change to how you use your devices.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="secure">More Secure/Private:</span>
              These items will require either technical knowledge, be very annoying, require
              serious planning, cause things to slow down, break things, or require a
              large amount of effort. 
            </li>
          </ul>
            Start where you're comfortable.

          üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Threat Modeling
        </h2>
        <p>
          The most important thing to consider when you are worried about privacy
          and security is your threat model. Who are you trying to hide your data
          from? If you only need to hide your data from your family, you may just
          need to delete your browser history. If you are trying to hide your data from
          governments and corporations, you will have to do quite a bit more work than
          just deleting your browser history. Come up with your threat model, and think about the
          tools that this adversary has at their disposal. Keep your threat model in mind
          when going through this guide.

        <p class="description">
          Your web browser is typically one of the most used programs on your system. Taking
          steps to lock down your web browser will greatly increase your privacy.

            Brave is easier out of the box. Firefox can be configured to be more private than Brave.

            Using social logins creates a single point of failure. If Google gets hacked and you use Google to login to everything, then all of your accounts are comprimised.

          Enabling 2FA makes it significantly harder to hack your accounts. Even if someone has your password they would also need to be able to authenticate with your 2FA device to login.

        <p class="description">
          VPNs are NOT a tool that make you more private. Rather they shift who can look at what you are doing. Without a VPN your ISP can see what websites you visit. With a VPN, your ISP can see that you are connecting all of your traffic to one server (VPN), and your VPN can see what websites you visit. This is important because many VPN sellers claim that they make you more private or secure which is NOT the case. If you just want to be more private or secure you do NOT need a VPN. However, VPNs are useful for bypassing censorship. If something is banned or blocked in your country, you may be able to bypass the block with a VPN.

          <p>
            Choosing a VPN with no logs is important because any logs could be handed over if requested. Having your service in a country with strong privacy laws reduces this risk, but remember the VPN can see your traffic.
